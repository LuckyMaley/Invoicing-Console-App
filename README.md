# Invoicing_Console_App


## Description
This system will allow employees to create invoices for products rendered to customers. It typically includes fields for details such as item descriptions, quantities, prices, taxes, discounts, and payment terms.                              
Customers will have the capability to review their invoices both before and after making payments. Each invoice will contain all necessary details, ensuring clarity and transparency in the billing process.  The system maintains a database of the customer information including contact details, billing addresses, payment preferences. This helps in accurately addressing invoices and tracking payment behaviour. Once generated, the invoices will be delivered to customers via email and electronic billing portals.

## Installation
Within a particular ecosystem, there may be a common way of installing things, such as using Yarn, NuGet, or Homebrew. However, consider the possibility that whoever is reading your README is a novice and would like more guidance. Listing specific steps helps remove ambiguity and gets people to using your project as quickly as possible. If it only runs in a specific context like a particular programming language version or operating system or has dependencies that have to be installed manually, also add a Requirements subsection.

## Visuals
Depending on what you are making, it can be a good idea to include screenshots or even a video (you'll frequently see GIFs rather than actual videos). Tools like ttygif can help, but check out Asciinema for a more sophisticated method.
